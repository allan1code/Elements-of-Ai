# Chapter 1 - What is Ai? 
#### Exercise 1: Is this AI or not?

Q.1 Ans: No. (Only usage of formulas is required, not Ai). 

Q.2 Ans: No. (Simple curve can characterized as not being Ai). 

Q.3 Ans: Yes. (Geometry and signal processing arenâ€™t to be considered AI but 

could be optimal suggestions for navigation - taking traffic into account. 

Q.4 Ans: Yes. (Not limited to listening behavior). 

Q.5 Ans: No. (Examples such as color balance, contrast, and so).


#### Exercise 2: Taxonomy of AI
Q.1 Ans: B (Artificial intelligence, branch of computer science).

Q.2 Ans: C (Machine learning, frequently mentioned as part of AI).

Q.3 Ans: A (Computer science being a broad field, including AI and other subfields such as distributed computing).

Q.4 Ans: E (Data science requires AI and artificial intelligence).

Q.5 Ans: D (Deep learning, the branch of machine learning).

#### Exercise 3: Examples of tasks
Q.1 Ans: Statistics | Robotics | Machine learning. 

Q.2 Ans: Robotics. 

Q.3 Ans: Statistics | Machine learning.

Q.4 Ans: Machine learning | Robotics.

Q.5 Ans: Statistics. 

#### Exercise 4: Definitions, definitions
Good definition would be "machines imitating intelligent human behavior", "cool things that computers can't do". Yes, in contrast "autonomous and adaptive systems" would be directly related to Deep learning.
